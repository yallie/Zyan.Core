An incomplete TODO list for Zyan.Core port:

+ RPC hello world
+ RPC with events
+ Event fails when a client disconnects unexpectedly
+ Exceptions
+ Exception translation
+ Message encryption on/off
+ Session management
- Session variables
+ ZyanHost events: Before/After/Invoke/Logon/Etc
- Call interception and caching
- Reconnecting clients after server restart
- Reconnecting clients after changing the current network
- Reconnecting clients after short connection loss
- Reconnecting clients after longer connection loss
- Call context for progress tracking/cancelling
+ Delegate parameters https://gist.github.com/yallie/d39a2e81106dc5572f1e2b5f519510eb
- Stream parameters (if possible) https://gist.github.com/yallie/7767323
- DryIoc server side support: server call scope
- Server-side MEF component registration
- Zyan-like authentication provider
- SRP authorization
- LINQ-provider, client-side LINQ, GetTable<T>
- LINQ expression parameters
- Client-side MEF catalog
- Method call interception and caching
- Disconnected and Reconnected events https://gist.github.com/yallie/437ea4c087725693e1c2
- Cancelling scheduled events on session termination
- Authorization with password change
- Two-factor authorization
- FormatUrl API for client protocol
- Look for more real appserver use cases

Not possible:

- Disconnect, then reconnect - not possible, requires re-creation of the channel
- Cluster host on the same port as main host - not possible, but certain services can be excluded from authentication via BeforeInvoke handler
